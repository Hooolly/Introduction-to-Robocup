# Introduction-to-Robocup
This git presents the work developed in the frame of BHuman. Robocup is a robot soccer competition around the world and robot NAO is humanoid robot made in Japan. Our robot acts as defender in the real competition. In this project, robot behaviour has been improved. For more details please check the final report.

## Task describtion
In this project our group come up with a new kicking strategy for defender and successfully implement it on the real robot NAO. The code is based on the BHuman frame. 
I'm responsible for the code part and mainly changed the code in the file *Introduction-to-Robocup/BHumanCodeRelease-coderelease2015/Src/Modules/BehaviorControl/BehaviorControl2015/Options/Roles/Defender.h* and file *Introduction-to-Robocup/BHumanCodeRelease-coderelease2015/Src/Modules/BehaviorControl/BehaviorControl2015/Libraries/LibCodeRelease.cpp*. 
Three new state is added in the head file and one dynamic kicking speed function is added in the control function library. My teammates did the analysis works and I'm responsible for the code implementation and simulation work.
